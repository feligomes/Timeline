# Timeline Event Visualizer

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project that implements an interactive timeline component for visualizing events.

ðŸš€ **Live Demo**: [https://timeline-manager.vercel.app/](https://timeline-manager.vercel.app/)

## Project Overview

This project implements a timeline visualization component with the following features:
- Drag and drop functionality to modify event dates
- Zoom controls for timeline navigation (Month, week, and day view options)
- Event editing

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/feligomes/Timeline
cd Timeline
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Implementation Details

### Time Spent
I spent approximately 4 hours implementing this project.

### Design Decisions
- Used Shadcn UI to create a modern look and feel aswell as an future-proof component library
- Used React Beautiful DND for smooth drag-and-drop interactions
- Managed date-fns to handle date manipulations
- Implemented multiple calendar views (month/week/day) for better user experience

### Features I Like
- The overall look and feel of the application
- The possibility to add new events and use custom colors for each one making them easier to identify
- The drag and drop functionality that allows moving events by specific days. You can for example move the 3rd day of the event to another day and the event will be updated accordingly
- The intuitive interface for event management
- The flexibility to view the calendar in different time scales (month/week/day)
- The possiblity to easily update existing events

### Future Improvements
- Implement a real API backend for event management
- Add user authentication and authorization
- Show user-specific event data based on login
- Improve responsiveness for small devices, potentially with a redesigned mobile-first interface
- Add data persistence
- Implement real-time updates

### Testing Approach
I would implement a comprehensive testing strategy including:
- End-to-end testing with Cypress to verify the complete user flow
- Unit testing with Jest for individual components and functions
- Integration tests for the drag and drop functionality
- Test coverage for different calendar views
- Accessibility testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
